Goal for today: Create the general layout of the website, choose any themes and colors that the website will primarily be based on and maybe start coding if I have time.

Progress: Started the outline of the website and the very basic template of a html file.

Plans: Refresh my knowledge on Javascript, CSS, and PHP and complete the outline.
